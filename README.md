# Covers for Tutoria MA111 & MA141

![A grid of small, subtly rotating orange squares.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/01.png?raw=true)

![a pattern made of small, rotating orange squares. They grow and become denser in such a way as to form a diagonal line going from top to bottom, left to right.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/02.png?raw=true)

![A grid of orange small orange squares. They are small, almost vanishing, in the bottom left corner, and larger in the top right corner.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/03.png?raw=true)

![A parabola is suggested by how squares that are laid out in a grid become denser or sparser.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/04.png?raw=true)

![Squares laid out in a grid suggest two semi-circles by how they become denser when closer to the circles' centers.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/05.png?raw=true)

![The shapes of a polynomial function are suggested by how squares, laid out in a grid, become denser or sparser.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/06.png?raw=true)

![Two triangles, one pointing up, the other pointing down, are suggested by how squares become smaller or bigger.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/07.png?raw=true)

![A line of squares forms a exponential curve going up. The background of the image consists of a gradient of bigger squares becoming smaller as they go down the page.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/08.png?raw=true)

![A chart showing an exponential growth.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/09.png?raw=true)

![A semi-circle made of orange squares and that looks like a setting sun.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/10.png?raw=true)

![Two gradients from dark to light are suggested by how squares change their sizes, going from big to small in one, and from small to big in the other.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/11.png?raw=true)

![Two triangles, one pointing up, the other pointing down, are suggested by how squares become smaller or bigger. In the center, a circle, half of it going from light to dark, the other half from dark to light.](https://github.com/caluap/capas-Tutoria-MA111-e-MA141/raw/master/imgs/12.png?raw=true)
